Game Play:
Ave Imperator is played in alternating rounds of combat where you and
your opponent select actions and carry them out. Both actions are
acted out at the same time. For example, if you chose to block and
your opponent choses also to block, the round will end and new
actions will be selected. If you chose to dodge and your opponent 
choses to attack, combat will be resolved.

Combat ends when one player falls below 0 health. At the
end of Combat the Emperor will pass judgement upon the fallen.
