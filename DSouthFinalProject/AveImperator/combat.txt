Combat:
Combat is resolved in rounds, during each round you and your
opponent will select your actions and combat will be resolved.

Attacks, of course, deal damage!
Damage is created at the attack, and mitigated by any defensive
actions.

Blocking will provide you with a temporary increase to your defense
potentially soaking up more damage than normal.

Dodge gives you a chance to completely move out of the path of an
incoming attack. At the cost of not doing any damage that round.

Parry gives you the chance to fully block the incoming attack of
your opponent and deal some damage as a counter
