Player Stats:
Player Stats are randomly assigned at the beginning of the game.
They are created as a random average and increased by your choice
of weapon and armor. Your base stats are:

Health - How much damage you can take before surrender.
Strength - How hard you can hit for with a weapon.
Agility - Your ability to parry and dodge incoming attacks
Defense Rating - The amount of damage you can mitigate.
Fatigue - As you fight, your combat prowess will decrease.
Favor - As you gain favor, your abilities will increase slightly.
If you fall in the arena, Favor will also play a factor in the
Emperor's judgement on you.
