Combat:
Combat is resolved in rounds, during each round you and your
opponent will select your actions and combat will be resolved.
There are many actions available to you in combat, attack, block
dodge, parry, counter, special attack, and recover. Not all of 
these options will be available to you during every combat round.

Attacks, of course, deal damage!
Damage is dealt by combining your strength with the damage of your
selected weapon mixed with some math voodoo and then mitigated by
your opponents defense.

Blocking will provide you with a temporary increase to your defense
potentially soaking up more damage than normal.

Dodge gives you a chance to completely move out of the path of an
incoming attack. At the cost of not doing any damage that round.

Parry gives you the chance to fully block the incoming attack of
your opponent and also confers a bonus to attack for the next round
BUT - if your parry fails, you take bonus damage from the current
attack.

Counter attacks are a quick block and strike to your opponent. You
will take reduced damage from your opponent and deal a small amount
of damage yourself this round. Counter attacks will only be
successful if your opponent attacks.

Special Attacks are provided based on the amount of Favor you have.
They are only available when you have more than 70% of your current
fatigue, and tire you out faster.  These attacks do increased 
damage when they are available.

Recover allows you gain back some fatigue during combat at the cost
of not attacking or defending that round.
